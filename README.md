# MoodLog

MoodLog is a simple MERN-based journaling app that allows users to record meaningful memories. As I am new to the development space, this was a project for me to hone my skills and, hopefully by the end, create something meaningful 

## Features

- 📓 Create personal journal entries (title, caption, and date)
- ✏️ Edit existing entries
- 🗑️ Delete entries
- 🔐 User authentication with login/signup

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## Installation

We will be using npm to install the dependencies required to run this project. Run the following:

```bash
# This installs backend dependencies
 npm install
# Change directory to the frontend
 cd frontend
# This installs frontend dependencies
 npm install
```
## Roadmap
I would like to add in the following features eventually:
- 🖼️ Add image upload support for journal entries
- ⏰ Implement a notification system to remind users to journal daily

## Project Status
In the works
